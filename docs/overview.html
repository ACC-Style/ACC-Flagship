<h2 class="sg" name="concept">Concept</h2>
<p class="sg">This design was build to be modular and compartmentalized.</p>
<ol>
<li class="sg"><strong>base</strong> - any file that deals with varables, fonts and basic typography (raw tags).</li>
<li class="sg"><strong>helpers</strong> or &apos;required.scss &apos; - Mostly mixens but some files that have &quot;required&quot; in the name are needed for other files to functions. any file that have been named with &quot;trump&quot; will</li>
<li class="sg"><strong>components</strong> - any combination of DOM elements that make up a widget, nav, or collection of tags.</li>
<li class="sg"><strong>vendor</strong> - Any included style from a javascript or framework that needs an override to be inline with ACC standards.</li>
<li class="sg"><strong>structure</strong> - Non-Styling Pure Page Layout Code.  Balanced Columns, Sidebars, Page Spacing etc...</li>
<li class="sg"><strong>views</strong> - Overrides of components when in specific cases of the page or theme they are in. Like Sidebar Box on the Home page would be &quot;_home.sidebarbox.scss&quot;</li>
<li class="sg"><strong>trumps</strong> or &apos;.trump.scss&apos; - utility classes that have either high specificty or should override other uses of the same style in earlier stylesheets.</li>
</ol>
<p class="sg">As you travel down the structure of the main document the included stylesheets should increase there specificty.</p>
